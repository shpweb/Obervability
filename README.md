## Grafana 

Grafana is a popular open source data visualization tool. It is another server process. It has a web interface to create custom dashboards that pull data from Prometheus (using the full power of the Prometheus query API to perform statistical transformations), display multiple metrics using graphical dashboards and can also generate alerts.

Grafana provides powerful and flexible facilities to create graphs of any metric available to Prometheus.
