### Visualization tools
Observability, especially at cloud scale, can generate huge volumes of data that become difficult for humans to parse. Visualization tools help to quickly make sense of data by correlating observability data into intuitive graphic displays.  
Grafana is a popular open source analytics platform that enables you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.[^1]
