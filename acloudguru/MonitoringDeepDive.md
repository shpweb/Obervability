# Grafana

* We're going to be using Grafana and not just the native web UI with Prometheus because you'll see that, as you expand out your monitoring platform, you're often not just pulling in data from Prometheus itself. Maybe you have EC2 CloudWatch going on because you're using AWS or maybe you simply have an ELK Stack to process your logs and you want to include that in your visualizations.
